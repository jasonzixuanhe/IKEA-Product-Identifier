# IKEA furniture identifier

## Goals

A *Functions* list:
- Identify genre of furniture
- Display list of furniture of that genre
- Identify the location of that specific furniture

The application will be used to **sort** different products from the IKEA catalogue,
nightstands, beds, sofas, and side tables...etc. 

This will be used by both customers and IKEA co-workers to identity products.
By typing "nightstands", the application will return a list of nightstands.
Ultimately I would like to also save the aisle and bin location of each item so
the user will know where to find the product. 

Another function I would like to add on is the ability to assign products to aisle
and bin locations in the most efficient matter. Each product has a different pallet size
and needs to be assigned a location that will fit it.

This product is interesting to me because I work at IKEA part-time, and I would
like to make a program to sort part of IKEA's furniture range.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add furniture to a collection.

- As a user, I want to be able to remove furniture from a collection.

- As a user, I want to see a description of that furniture and, also show
where the furniture is located in the warehouse.

- As a user, I want to be able to print all furniture in a collection list.

- As a user, I want to be able to save my to-do list to file.

- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my to-do list from file

- As a user, I want to be able to load and save the state of the application

- Test and design a class in your model package that is robust.  You must have at least one method that throws a checked
  exception.  You must have one test for the case where the exception is expected and another where the exception 
  is not expected.

## Phase 4: Task 3
Some changes I would have made if I had more time to clean up my program

- Cleaning up GUI class, currently I have many instances of nesting in GUI class, I would want
  to add more classes to help separate and make the code more readable.
 
- A new folder for all my images and sounds which I used for the GUI portion of the project. It 
  will help with organization of the code.
 
- Adding an Exceptions folder and creating more exceptions to help with understanding errors.

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
